Instructions:
Implementation of a .NET MAUI app for Android / iOS which will consume a free weather
API (e.g. https://openweathermap.org/api) and will show on the Screen information about
the weather of an area. You can choose which weather information to display and how.

Requirements:
● The Application will accept as input the area for which we want to see the weather
forecast.
● The input will be given by an Entry or by the current location of the device. Both
ways should be implemented.
● There should be a success sound after each weather information download and a
failure sound when the call is not successful.
● While waiting for the response from the API, the app should be responsive.
● You should use MVVM pattern without an external library.
